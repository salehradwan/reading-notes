What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

Using The Software That Already
Comes With Your Computer
Now that we’ve talked about some of the features one might be
interested in if they were interested in a text editor. Let’s talk about
some of your options—beginning with the software that comes on
your computer.
Every computer will come with its own text editor. On Mac
computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called,
“Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with
your computer is called, “Notepad.”
And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text
editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of
your particular distribution. These text editors will go by different
names. One distro might have “Gedit,” and others might have other
titles. Check you list of applications to see which text editor comes
with your distribution of Linux.
Since these text editors already come on your computers, why should
you download yet another text editor that does essentially the same
thing as the text editor that you already have? There are other text
editors that have features that you may be interested in, like the ones
we discussed before. Usually, the text editors that come on your
computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest
bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.
While you certainly can use Notepad and Text Edit to make websites,
there are other text editors available that might help you code more
efficiently. I invite you to judge for yourself and form your own
opinions.
If you want to try using the text editors that come with your
computer, there’s a couple of caveats that I’d like to make you aware
of:
Please make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on
your computer, that you’re creating code in a plain text editor. You
should not see options for making text bold, underlined, or italic.
Plain text has no formatting options. There is no need to bold,
underline or italicize code. If you can make your text bold, underlined
or italic, then you might need to change a setting somewhere. Please
make sure you’re coding in plain text.
Also, make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your
computer, that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere
(maybe on your Desktop, for example) to store your entire website.
As you create new documents with the text editor that comes on your
computer, save those files in the appropriate folders or sub-folders
within the main website folder.
Also, please make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they
have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names. For
example, your main HTML file should be called, “index.html.” Your
CSS file should be called something like “style.css.” The filename isn’t
as important as the extension (the “.html” and the “.css”).
I think you’ll find that when using the text editors that come on your
computer, that there are no special bells or whistles at all. I think
you’ll find that there is no code completion. But what that means is
your text editor won’t assist you in finding your mistakes. You’ll have
to discover them on your own.
I think you’ll find that there is no syntax highlighting, no themes and
no extensions. While you most certainly can use them to make a
website, I think the real question is, “Should you?” They’re not the
most feature rich text editors available.
Third-Party Options
Ok, what about third-party options? Let’s talk about software like:
Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded
and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each
of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked
about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are
widely used in web development today.
NotePad++
NotePad++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only.
NotePad++ has been around for many years and many web
developers swear by NotePad++. It has syntax highlighting and code
completion, as well as word completion and function completion. It
has a zoom in an out feature, it’s own online community, and its own
chat room for questions that may arise. It even has its own searchable
wiki page for more assistance
TextWrangler/BB Edit
TextWrangler is for Mac computers only, and you used to be able to
download it from the Mac App Store. In doing my research for this
blog post, I’ve come to find out that TextWrangler has been retired. I
know, I’m a little late to the party with this news, but TextWrangler
was retired in 2017. This was one of the go-to text editors for Mac
Computers.
But all hope is not lost, the folks that make TextWrangler, Bare Bones
Software has incorporated TextWrangler into its more robust, big
brother, BB Edit—another feature packed text editor
BB Edit is software that you purchase. But BB Edit comes with a 30-
day free trial. After the 30 days is over, if you still want the free
version, simply continue using BB Edit, and you’ll get the same
features as you would have gotten in TextWrangler. If you want the
full features in BB Edit, the full cost for a full license is $49.99. Find

Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.
It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux
computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has
everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code
completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following in the
web developing community.
Atom
Atom is a free text editor that’s available for download for Windows
computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. Atom is brought to
you by the folks at GitHub . GitHub is a great service online where
you can host and review code, or you can post and get help with the
development of your own projects. Atom also ticks all the right boxes.
It has syntax highlighting, themes, extensions, the works! Atom is
definitely a software to check out and test drive for yourself.
Brackets
Brackets is a free text editor that’s available for download for
Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. It’s made
and maintained by the good folks at Adobe—yep, the Photoshop
people. Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, though
more coding capabilities can be added through extensions. Being that
Brackets only supports HTML, CSS and JavaScript, this might be a
great choice to start with. But still the choice is yours.
Brackets includes all of the features one may want when using a text
editor including something called “Live Preview” which updates your
website once you make a change automatically. So, you can’t go
wrong with Brackets.
Sublime Text
Sublime Text 3 is a premium software that can be purchased in full
for $70. Otherwise you’ll use the free version. Sublime Text enjoys a
history of being fast and responsive while being extensible as well.
There’s no doubt that Sublime Text will tick the check boxes of what
to look for in a text editor. It has syntax highlighting, it has code
completion, it has themes and extensions. And will definitely get the
job done no matter how advanced you get with your coding.
The Difference Between Text
Editors and IDEs
A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
You can think about an IDE very much like Microsoft Outlook. If
you’ve ever used Microsoft Outlook, you would have quickly noticed
that it was an email client, a calendar, a task manager, a to-do list all
in one software package. Similar to how an IDE is an all-in-one
software package.
While you might not be ready, or have the need to use a compiler, or
a debugger when you’re just starting out in web development, you’ll
get to see how an IDE operates in your text editing software. When
you’re ready to use an IDE, you’ll be more confident in how to use it
because you’ll already had some experience with it by using your text
editor.
Me? I’ll stick with the text-editors I’ve mentioned above. I’ve been
using them all on and off for a while, but I can’t seem to make up my
mind which one I want forever and ever. What happens to me is that
I’ll stick with one text editor for a while, only to find out that the
others have all been updated so radically that they have new and
exciting features. So, I’ll start using that updated text editor for a
while, and in the meanwhile, the others will be updated. So, I’ll start
using those ones. It’s a viscous cycle.
It would be so interesting to hear what some of you are using for your
text editor. Please share and let us know which text editor is your
favorite and why. Let’s make this a nice robust list of our favorite text
editors for all of us who are new to web development.
