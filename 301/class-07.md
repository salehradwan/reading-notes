# REST

## Who is Roy Fielding?

Some guy. He's smart.
He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because of the multiplicity of programming languages we need a compiler to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
GET, POST, PUT & PATCH
computers can use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other.

## What does a GET do?

Can be applied to many different nouns. Some verbs are more specific than others and apply only to a small set of nouns.

## What does a POST do?

is the diagnostic testing sequence that a computer's basic input/output system (or "starting program") runs to determine if the computer keyboard, random access memory, disk drives, and other hardware are working correctly.

## What does PUT do?

PUT method is used to update resource available on the server. Typically, it replaces whatever exists at the target URL with something else. You can use it to make a new resource or overwrite an existing one.

## What does PATCH do?

A patch is a set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches usually being called bugfixes or bug fixes.
